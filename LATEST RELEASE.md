In Tunnel Rat, you play as a rodent, and need to escape a maze of sewer tunnels while also avoiding being caught by sewer cats. In the game you traverse tunnels with very little view distance, and the only way to beat the game is to escape the system of tunnels (One exit, and One Live). Since you have limited view and cats will make no noise, you need to be careful and react quickly when you come across one. Once a cat catches you, a subsequent jump scare will play, and you will be eaten and taken back to the main menu. Another aspect to be aware of is cheese. Cheese will be hidden around the tunnels and will provide a slight stamina boost. The incentive to collect the cheese is that it will make out running a cat less difficult. The gameplay will consist of memorizing dead ends, collecting cheese, and carefully calculating every movement to avoid being caught by cats.
